Group 1 BtheB Homework Assignment
========================================================

We created two regression lines each for treatments,"TAU" and "BtheB" from the "BtheB" data set.

We found a steeper slope in the BtheB treatment plot, which indicates that the BtheB treatment is more effective for patietns with more severe depression.


```{r}
library(HSAUR2)
library(ggplot2)

data("BtheB")
summary(BtheB)
qplot(bdi.pre, bdi.4m, data=BtheB, geom=c("point", "smooth"),method="lm") + facet_grid(.~ treatment) + theme_bw()

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
